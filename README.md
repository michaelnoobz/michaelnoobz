<h1> Hey My Name is Michael !! i am new to this so please forgive me in my mistakes and clunkyness!! welcome to my page.</h1>
<h1>IM BACK!!!!</h1>
<body> Lets tell you about my self with out Doxing my self. I grew up in a small town i orginally didnt care about a career all i wanted to do was play games and mess with tech. eventually i had to set my sights on somthing and decided to go to do computer aided drafting. i had a few jobs doing that but it wasnt for me. i bounced from retail to contruction and yes even a call center. i kept going around trying to find some where i can enjoy my work and still be able to make a living. 

I remembered liking computers and tech when i was a kid and still did but to broke to buy any thing new. so i looked it up online and i seen cyber security was a booming industry good money and somthing you can build and create value for your self and companies, so i looked into what it was, i was shocked it looked fun, but of course you learn the hard way people do not tell you the real thing about being in the cyber industry. so i started trying to learn on my own and holy smokes i was overwhelmed i wanted to try everything but quickly relized i needed structure to get a decent foundation so i can atleast find my way around and understand half of what was being showned or taught. 

i looked for a college that was quick and gave me foundations and some certs. I graduated with a associates in cyber security, and obtained the ITF+, Network+, Security+, CySa+, CSAP. all with in a year and a half. During this time my wife and i had a kid and decided to get serious about trying to make somthing for my family and leave a legacy. so i applied to over 2000 jobs in less than a year finally got a call back from a non profit health clinic with rewarding missions and meaningful work. i was hired at a low salary for what i was doing compared to nation average. but i learned alot, grateful for it to be honest. I was asked in a interview why do i want to leave.. i dont but i think its time i learned a new role in a more security focused company. i love the people i work with and i love the job but im tired of delviering food and grocerys every night with my kid in the back seat trying to make ends meet. i want to grow and add more value to somthing more than what i do now. thanks for reading!!</body>

<body> p.s. Currently seeking roles in Security Operations / Incident Response where I can leverage my advanced certifications (CySA+, CSAP) to secure dynamic environments.</body>

<body 1> During my Hiatus i got interviewed at a top company... didnt make the cut! but heres to more learning and getting more experience!! </body>

<body 1> They had me do a Capture the flag for a screening and, i found some spots I am lacking as well as them saying i needed a bit more experience. So for a little while to get more experince, I am going to work on Parsing information for huge logs, downloading Splunk free, python scripting!!and possibly mock playbooks? just to get more exposure to it. </body>
