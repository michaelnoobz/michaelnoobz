### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a dedicated Security Professional with a deep focus on **Security Operations (SecOps)** and **Incident Response**. I specialize in bridging the gap between IT infrastructure and security analytics. I recently leveraged the **Splunk Pledge** to architect a full-scale **Splunk Enterprise SIEM** for a non-profit organization, scaling from 0 to 150 nodes in a single production shift.

### 🏗️ Featured Project: Enterprise Splunk Ingestion Pipeline
**Role:** Lead Security Architect (Hardware Scavenging to Production Deployment)
https://github.com/michaelnoobz/Splunk-homelab-and-work-set-up/blob/main/README.md

I managed the end-to-end architecture and rollout of a **Splunk Enterprise** instance on a custom-built Linux server to monitor a 150-node Windows fleet.

* **Storage Engineering:** Optimized a scrounged hardware array using **Linux LVM**, creating a unified 1TB logical volume for high-velocity data indexing.
* **Automated Fleet Rollout:** Engineered a **PowerShell deployment wrapper** executed via **NinjaOne RMM**.
* **Binary Distribution:** Hosted the `.msi` payload via a **Python-based HTTP listener** on an Ubuntu server to minimize WAN impact and ensure wire-speed distribution.
* **SOC Use Cases:** Configured real-time ingestion for **EventCode 4625** (Brute Force) and **4104** (PowerShell Script Block Logging).
